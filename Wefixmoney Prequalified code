An "instant" personal loan is a personal loan in which the lender immediately makes a decision on whether to approve the loan. These lenders aim to evaluate your application and send you your funds quickly, if not always instantly.

An instant personal loan works in the same way as a standard personal loan. You can apply online or in person. The lender will perform a credit check to decide if you qualify for the loan and determine what interest rate to offer you.

If you are approved for the loan and accept it, the lender will send you a lump sum of money. You must then pay this money back, generally in equal monthly installments over a set period, which is typically a few months to several years. You'll pay interest on the loan, and sometimes fees.
